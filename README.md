## Purpose

This practical section serves to:
- Provide hands-on examples that complement the Advanced React book
- Demonstrate key concepts through interactive code examples
- Share knowledge 

## Chapters

This repository covers the following chapters from the Advanced React book:

### 1. Moving State Down
Demonstrates how moving state down the component tree prevents unnecessary re-renders of heavy components. Shows the performance difference between keeping state in a parent component (causing delayed modal appearance) versus moving state to a child component (allowing instant modal display).

### 2. Rerender Myth
Explores common misconceptions about React re-renders and how React efficiently manages component updates.

### 3. Children Prop Pattern for Performance
Shows how to use the children prop pattern to improve performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders in React applications.

### 4. State Reset
Illustrates how React handles state reset and reconciliation when component keys change.

### 5. Dynamic Lists & Keys
Covers best practices for rendering dynamic lists in React, including proper key usage and common pitfalls.

### 6. Memoizing Props Anti-Pattern
Explains anti-patterns related to memoizing props and demonstrates the correct approaches to optimize component performance.

## Getting Started

This project uses React with Vite. To get started:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## About

Created by **Mariam** for learning and sharing knowledge about advanced React concepts.
